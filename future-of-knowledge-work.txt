comments
  disruption from the pandemic is leading people to reflect on their lifestyles, relationships, and priorities
  more willing to take big risks and make big changes (moving, quitting, divorcing, demanding a new work-life balance)

predictions

40-50% of knowledge workers will work remotely, and that will stay pretty stable indefinitely

time zones will still matter, but not as much as they used to

knowledge worker unions will proliferate, but look different than traditional unions

part time work, hourly contracting, self-employment, and job sharing will be way more common in the post-pandemic world
  a white collar gig economy?
